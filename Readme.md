This repository serves as my personal projects portfolio. Here you'll find projects from different areas I've done so far.

Also, some of the projects which I've worked upon won't have a repository or live link because my Non-Disclosure with the organizations/clients I worked with, binds me from sharing them publically.

***Description:***
ExamProctor is an AI based examination proctoring tool which helps register students for an online examination and monitors their actions during the time of examination using computer vision and nlp techniques. It provides features for candidate/proctor registration and monitor them using Face Detection, Face Recognition, Speech Detection, Speech To text Conversion, NLP, Object Detection, Locked/Safe Browsing, OCR, etc. to check if a candidate is cheating or not and if found cheating then an appropriate flag is raised.
At the end of examination, the admins/proctors can see  the entire candidate list with analytics of various flags raised and generates a Candidate Credibility Score which can be used by admins to cancel or accept the candidate's exam.
