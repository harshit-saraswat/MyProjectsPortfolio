# MyProjectsPortfolio
This repository serves as my personal projects portfolio. Here you'll find projects from different areas I've done so far.

Also, some of the projects which I've worked upon won't have a repository or live link because my Non-Disclosure with the organizations/clients I worked with, binds me from sharing them publically.
